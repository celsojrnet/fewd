<h1>Whales</h1>

<p>Wikipedia tells us this about <b>whales:</b>
</p>

<p>Whale is the common name for various marine mammals of the order Cetacea.
The term whale sometimes refers to all cetaceans, but more often it excludes
dolphins and porpoises, which belong to the suborder Odontoceti (toothed
whales). This suborder includes the sperm whale, killer whale, pilot whale,
and beluga whale. The other cetacean suborder, Mysticeti (baleen whales),
comprises filter feeders who eat samll organisms caught by straining seawater
through a comblike structure found in the mouth called baleen.This suorder
includes the blue whale, the humpback whale, the bowhead whale and the minke
whale. All cetaceans have forelimbs modified as fins, a tail with horizontal
flukes, and nasal openings (blowholes) on top of the head.

<p>But I like whales because they are:

<Li>Huge!</li>
  <li>Friendly</li>
  <li>Can hold their breath for a long time</li>

<h2>Whale Anatomy</h2>

<p>There are some key parts to a whale's anatomy that I think are interesting.
</P>

<ol>
  <li><b>Blowhole:</b> Whales breathe via blowholes; baleen whales have two
  and toothed whales have one. These are located on the head, allowing the
  animal to remain almost complettely submerged while breathing. Breathing
  involves expelling stale air (which is warm and moist), as well as some
  mucus and axcess water from the blowhole, forming an upward, steamy spout,
  followed by inhaling fresh air into the lungs. Spout shapes differ among
  species, which facilitates identification.</li>
  <li><b>Ears:</b> The whale ear has specific adptations to the marine
  environment. In humans, the middle ear works as an impedance equalizer between
  the outside air's low impedance and the cochlear fluid's high impedance. In
  aquatic mammals, such as wheals, however, there is no great difference between
  the outer and inner environments. Instead of sound passing through the outer
  er to the middle ear, whales receive sound through the throat, from which it
  passes through a low-impedance fat-filled cavity to the inner ear. The whale
  ear is acoustically isolated from the skull by air-filled sinus pockets,
  which allow for great directional hearing underwater.</li>
